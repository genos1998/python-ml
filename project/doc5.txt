Word2Vec does not need labels in order to create meaningful representations. This is useful, since most data in the real world is unlabeled. If the network is given enough training data (tens of billions of words), it produces word vectors with intriguing characteristics. Words with similar meanings appear in clusters, and clusters are spaced such that some word relationships, such as analogies, can be reproduced using vector math.
