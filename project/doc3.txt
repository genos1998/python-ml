Deep learning has been in the news a lot over the past few years, even making it to the front page of the New York Times. These machine learning techniques, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and made possible by recent advances in computing power, have been making waves via breakthrough results in image recognition, speech processing, and natural language tasks. Recently, deep learning approaches won several Kaggle competitions, including a drug discovery task, and cat and dog image recognition.
